Deep Learning Project
---------------------

Data collection:
----------------

-   Data gathered by following the hero in a very dense crowd. In this case, the quad is in the follow mode and the heroâ€™s back images are collected. The dense
cloud also provides enough training data for distinguishing people and hero.

-   Data gathered by capturing images of hero from far away. In order to improve
    the accuracy of hero classification from far away.

-   Data gathered while in patrol directly over the hero, while the hero zigzag.
    In order to get the 360 view of hero walking.

Segmentation Network 
=====================

-   Encoder block:

```

    encoder1 = encoder_block(inputs, filters=32, strides=2)

    encoder2 = encoder_block(encoder1, filters=64, strides=2)

    encoder3 = encoder_block(encoder2, filters=128, strides=2)

```

-   1x1 Convolution

```
 conv_1x1 = conv2d_batchnorm(encoder3, filters=264, kernel_size=1, strides=1)
```

-   Deconder block:

```

    decoder1 = decoder_block(small_ip_layer=conv_1x1, large_ip_layer=encoder2, filters=128)

    decoder2 = decoder_block(small_ip_layer=decoder1, large_ip_layer=encoder1, filters=64)

    decoder3 = decoder_block(small_ip_layer=decoder2, large_ip_layer=inputs, filters=32)
```
